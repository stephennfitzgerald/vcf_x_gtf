you will need to have the perl module Vcf.pm installed.

use anonymous ftp to ftp.sanger.ac.uk

then 

ftp> cd /pub/project/havana/vcf_test
ftp> get test.tar.gz
ftp> exit

bash > gunzip test.tar.gz 
bash > tar -xvf test.tar
bash > cd test
bash > perl t.pl --vcf_file data/mod_ex.vcf.gz --intron_offset 2 

this runs the small (modified) example VCF file with the following tab delimited columns:

seq_region position id ref_allele alt_allele qual filter info format gene_id transcript_id transcript_biotype feature_hit* exon_id cds**

*feature_hit: if the variation falls within an exon (exon), an intron (intron) or within a specified number of bases of 
the either end of an exon (the default value is 8bp and the value is set in the variable $intron_offset)

**cds: Does the variation affect the CDS (0=No, 1=Yes)

The script (t.pl) will use the following files in the data directory:
EIEEgenes_gencode19.gtf (EIEE annotation in Gencode 19),
EIEEgenes_loutre.GRCh38-GRCh37-lift.mapped (70 EIEE gene loutre annotation, lifted back to GRCh37),
refseq_70_37backmap.gtf (EIEE Refseq annotation).
to intersect with your input VCF file. In the example the input VCF file is mod_ex.vcf.gz, which is a modified version
of the file (example.vcf.gz) given to us, such that the modified file has some variants which intersect with the genes 
in the gtf files.
